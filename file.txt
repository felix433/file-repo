### ☁️ *"Reaching for the Cloud: Felix’s Journey into Cloud Computing"*

In a quiet room filled with glowing monitors, **Felix**, a curious university student, sat hunched over his laptop, deep in research. While others spent their time scrolling social media, Felix was chasing something bigger — the **cloud**.

At first, the term "cloud computing" sounded mysterious, even confusing. *“Why call it a cloud if it's just someone else’s computer?”* he thought. But the deeper he dug, the more powerful it became.

He learned that cloud computing is the **backbone of the modern digital world**. From storing files in Google Drive to running massive applications like Netflix and Zoom, the cloud powers it all.

Felix explored the **three core service models**:

* **IaaS** – Infrastructure as a Service, like renting virtual computers (e.g., AWS EC2).
* **PaaS** – Platform as a Service, for developers who want to build without managing servers (e.g., Heroku).
* **SaaS** – Software as a Service, where apps like Gmail just work over the web.

But Felix didn’t stop at reading — he got hands-on. He spun up virtual machines on AWS, configured cloud storage, and even experimented with containers and **Terraform**. He learned about **high availability**, **scalability**, and how to deploy applications with just a few clicks or lines of code.

Every day, Felix documented his findings, committed projects to Git, and sharpened his skills. What began as curiosity had become a mission: to become a **cloud engineer** who builds secure, scalable systems for the future.

His journey wasn’t just about technology — it was about learning how to solve real-world problems, think critically, and adapt in an ever-evolving tech landscape.

And as Felix pushed his latest project to GitHub, he smiled, knowing one thing for sure:

> “The sky is no longer the limit — not when you work in the cloud.”
